# -Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Excel-Data-Analytics-Project
This project demonstrates a complete Excel-based data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, data transformation, pivot table analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze bike-buying behavior based on customer demographics and commute patterns.
Using Excel, I cleaned raw customer data, created analytical pivot tables, and built an interactive dashboard using slicers and charts.

📁 File Structure
Sheet Name	Description
bike_buyers	Raw dataset containing customer details.
Worksheet	Cleaned and transformed version of the dataset.
pivot Table	Contains multiple pivot tables used for dashboard visualizations.
Dashboard	Final dashboard with slicers and charts.
🧹 Data Cleaning (Worksheet Sheet)

Key cleaning steps performed:

Removed duplicates and blank rows

Standardized categorical values (Marital Status, Region, Education, Gender)

Cleaned numeric values (Income, Age, Commute Distance)

Corrected inconsistent formats for dates and text

Used formulas to fix errors (TRIM, PROPER, IF, TEXT, DATE)

📊 Pivot Table Analysis
1️⃣ Pivot: Average Income by Gender & Purchase Status

Rows: Gender (Male, Female)

Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes / No)

Values: Average of Income

Insight: Helps compare purchasing behavior by gender and income level.

2️⃣ Pivot: Purchase Count by Commute Distance

Rows: Commute Miles (0–1, 1–2, 2–5, 5–10, 10+ miles)

Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes / No)

Values: Count of Purchased Bike

Insight: Shows impact of distance on bike-buying decisions.

3️⃣ Pivot: Purchase Count by Age Bracket

Rows: Age Groups (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old)

Columns: Purchased Bike (Yes / No)

Values: Count of Purchased Bike

Insight: Highlights which age group buys bikes most frequently.
